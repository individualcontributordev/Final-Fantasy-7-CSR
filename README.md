These patches can be applied to the following platforms

- Playstation 1 and 2 (PSX Disc)
- Emulator (Digital)

## Definition

All "skill checks" remain in this CSR (if not let me know and I'll fix it). A skill check is any action a player must perform in game, e.g. choosing an option in dialogues, movement in cutscenes, skips, manipulating RNG, etc. Most FMVs are removed, some cutscenes are shorter, and long mashing sequences have been reduced. This CSR is exactly like a non-CSR run, just shorter.

## Steps

Apply the patches to your FF7 NTSC/US PS1 .bin files.

1. Go to https://www.romhacking.net/patch/
2. Select your original .bin file, ignore the "file too big" warning
3. Select the patch .ppf file
4. Click the "Apply patch" button

Your browser should download a new patched version of the disc.

You can burn the patched version to disc or load it up in an emulator (I used duckstation version 0.1-7371-gb2577ef8b (dev) for testing). I used ImgBurn with write speed 16x on Verbatim CD-R 700MB discs.

Make sure to choose the correct patch .ppf file for the correct disc you are trying to patch.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure your FF7 .bin and .cue files for all discs are in the same directory, and the .bin and .cue for each disc are named exactly the same. e.g. 

```text
- Final Fantasy VII (Disc 1) CSR (patched).bin  
- Final Fantasy VII (Disc 1) CSR (patched).cue  
- Final Fantasy VII (Disc 2) CSR (patched).bin  
- Final Fantasy VII (Disc 2) CSR (patched).cue  
- Final Fantasy VII (Disc 3).bin  
- Final Fantasy VII (Disc 3).cue
```

You should also verify that .cue file references the correct filename of the .bin file, edit the .cue file if you change the name of the files. e.g.

**Final Fantasy VII (Disc 1) CSR (patched).cue**
```text
FILE "Final Fantasy VII (Disc 1) CSR (patched).bin" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE2/2352
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
```

And if you use a .m3u file like I do in DuckStation make sure to update this file to point to the correct patched version of the discs. e.g.

```text
C:\Users\Deez\Nutz\FF7\Final Fantasy VII (Disc 1) CSR (patched).cue
C:\Users\Deez\Nutz\FF7\Final Fantasy VII (Disc 2) CSR (patched).cue
C:\Users\Deez\Nutz\FF7\Final Fantasy VII (Disc 3).cue
```
